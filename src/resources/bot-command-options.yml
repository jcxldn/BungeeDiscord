# Bungee Discord
# Make sure there is always a space after any :

# Bot Commands and Description Messages (for !bd)
# Feel free to customize this if you'd like, but you can leave all of this as-is.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# If you are missing an entry, for example when you update the plugin,
# you will recieve a warning in the console on startup.

# For the missing entry, the defaults will be used.

# If you want to customize these new commands,
# you will need to either add the new entries here or delete this file and restart your server.
# Note that if you delete this file any changes to it will be lost.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# There are also other commands under the '!bd' prefix.
# Type '!bd' in discord to see all commands.
